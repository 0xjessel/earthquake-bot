# Overview

`fetch_and_post_earthquake.py` is run via a cron job on Dreamhost that is scheduled to run every 5 minutes.

`fetch_new_earthquakes()` gets the latest data from the USGS API. The script monitors earthquakes within a 300-mile radius and filters them based on distance and magnitude:

- Within 25 miles: Reports ALL earthquakes
- 25-50 miles: Reports earthquakes M2.0 and above
- 50-100 miles: Reports earthquakes M4.0 and above
- 100-200 miles: Reports earthquakes M5.0 and above
- 200-300 miles: Reports earthquakes M7.0 and above

25 mile radius:

`post_to_threads()` takes the earthquake data and calls the threads API to publish a post. I include the USGS link to the earthquake details plus a google maps link to the coordinates of the earthquake epicenter.

I also schedule `th_access_token.py` to be a cron job that's run every month to keep the access token valid.
